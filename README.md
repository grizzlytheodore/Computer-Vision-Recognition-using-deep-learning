# Computer-Vision-Face_Recognition_using_deep_learning

This program creates a training set for the convolutional neural network machine for recognizing faces. 
The umass website provides a bunch of pictures that include the faces and data of the exact elipses size and placement
of the faces. 

From there, we had to crop the faces, give them a score. In a real trainig setting we would also create many 
training examples that are not faces.
