This program creates a training set for the convolutional neural network machine for recognizing faces. Once you have the training set ready, much of the industry just feed the training set through arguments into a neural networks machine that is already made by the tensorflow library. But I have the knowledge and the ability to make my own neural networks machine; it is shown in my machine learning project.
The umass website provides a bunch of pictures that include the faces and data of the exact elipses size and placement
of the faces. 

From there, we had to crop the faces, give them a score. In a real trainig setting we would also create many 
training examples that are not faces.
